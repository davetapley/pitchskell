# pitchskell

Successor to [PitchCam Rails](https://github.com/dukedave/pitchcam-rails).

See [this talk](https://youtu.be/01CFyu3SuIo) for more info. Now I'm doing it with Haskell.

Depends on [OpenCV](https://github.com/LumiGuide/haskell-opencv), ask me about getting that set up.

This is a **work in progress**, it's just `stack test` at the moment.
